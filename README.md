GENO-ontology
=============

This repository holds OWL modeling for representing genotypes and their association with phenotypes.

GENO models genetic variation in a way that mirrors the conceptual components implicit in genotype representations - from a full genotype representing variation across an entire genome, down to allelic variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms. These components of a genotype are represented as a partonomy that supports integration of G2P data where phenotype annotations are made at different levels in this partonomy.  Ongoing work in GENO will model the structure and provenance of G2P associations, including relations between units of genetic variation, phenotypes and environments, and supporting evidence for these associations. 

GENO is an open source ontology.  It is orthogonal to the sequence ontology, and we are working with SO developers to align representations and re-use common terms where there is overlap/contact between the ontologies. Official documentation is under development, but a high level overview can be found in the slide deck here: http://www.slideshare.net/mhb120/brush-icbo-2013
